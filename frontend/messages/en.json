    "content": "SORA Tattoo stands for clarity, precision, and artistic freedom.\nOur studio in Berlin is a place where ideas take shape and personal stories become visible.\nWe don't work with a rigid surface, but with the body in motion – lines follow rhythm, flow, and natural dynamics.\nFor us, skin is not a canvas substitute, but part of the composition.\nEmptiness doesn't mean absence, but balance – a conscious pause within the entire visual dialogue.\nWith care, transparency, and the highest standards of quality and safety, each tattoo emerges as part of a greater whole."
